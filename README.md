# Project #7 - Philosophers

This project aims to teach concurrent programming, focusing on multithreading.

It is based on the "Dining philosophers problem", stated by Edsger Dijkstra.

In this project, I learned the basics of threading a process as:
- the creation of threads
- the management of mutexes and data races

I also had the opportunity to use C data structures in order to communicate with multiple threads.
